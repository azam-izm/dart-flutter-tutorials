Q1: What is the difference between .where and .reduce in Dart?

ANS: .where: Filters elements in a collection based on a condition and returns a new iterable.
Example: listName.where((n) => n % 2 == 0) → filters even numbers.

.reduce: Combines all elements into a single value (e.g., sum, product).
Example: listName.reduce((a, b) => a + b) → calculates the sum.
