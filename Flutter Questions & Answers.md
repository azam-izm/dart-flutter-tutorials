**Q: Why does Flutter throw an error when adding a nested list inside children: in widgets like Column, Row, or Stack?**

Widgets like Column, Row, and Stack expect a flat list of widgets, but a nested list (List<List<Widget>>) causes a type mismatch.

ðŸ”§ Fix: Use the spread operator (...) to unpack lists inside children: or assign a generated list directly.

This rule applies to all collection-based widgets in Flutter, including ListView, Wrap, and GridView.
