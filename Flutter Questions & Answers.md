**Q: In Flutter BLoC, which widgets are used to interact with the state in the UI?**

1. BlocBuilder → Rebuilds UI when the state changes.


2. BlocListener → Listens for state changes and triggers side effects (e.g., Snackbar).


3. BlocConsumer → A combination of BlocListener and BlocBuilder (listens + rebuilds).


4. BlocSelector → Selects and listens to a specific part of the state, optimizing rebuilds.

Most commonly, developers use BlocBuilder, BlocListener, and BlocConsumer, but BlocSelector is also an important tool for improving performance.

**Q: What is the difference between BlocBuilder and BlocListener in Flutter's BLoC package?**

BlocBuilder: Always returns a widget and rebuilds the UI when the state changes.

BlocListener: Never returns a widget; it only executes side effects (e.g., showing a SnackBar or navigating) without affecting the UI.

```
// UI update using BlocBuilder
BlocBuilder<CounterBloc, int>(
  builder: (context, state) {
    return Text('Count: $state'); // Always returns a widget
  },
);

// Side effect using BlocListener
BlocListener<CounterBloc, int>(
  listener: (context, state) {
    if (state == 5) {
      // Executes a side effect, never returns a widget
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Count reached 5!')),
      );
    }
  },
  child: Container(), // A child widget can be provided
);
```

**Q: Why does Flutter throw an error when adding a nested list inside children: in widgets like Column, Row, or Stack?**

Widgets like Column, Row, and Stack expect a flat list of widgets, but a nested list (List<List<Widget>>) causes a type mismatch. Use the spread operator (...) to unpack lists inside children: or assign a generated list directly. This rule applies to all collection-based widgets in Flutter, including ListView, Wrap, and GridView.
```
Column(
  children: [
    Text("Item 1"),
    ...[Text("Item 2"), Text("Item 3")], // ✅ FIXED: Spreads elements
  ],
)
```
```
Column(
  children: List.generate(3, (index) => Text("Item ${index + 1}")), // ✅ Works fine
)
```

**Q: How can I set up routes in MaterialApp without using initialRoute or home?**

Use the routes property to map each screen to a named route, like this:
```
routes: {
  '/': (context) => const Screen1(),
  'screen2': (context) => const Screen2(),
  'screen3': (context) => const Screen3(),
}
```

**Q: What does Bloc provide in Flutter, and what are its core features?**


Bloc (Business Logic Component) provides a predictable state management solution in Flutter, following the BLoC pattern. Its core features include separating business logic from UI, managing state through streams, and ensuring a clear flow of data with events and states, promoting scalability and testability.

**===== Flutter Questions & Answers =====**

**Q: What is the difference between Provider, GetX, Riverpod, and Bloc in terms of dependency injection and routing?**

Dependency Injection:
```
Provider and GetX provide built-in dependency injection features.
Riverpod and Bloc do not offer direct dependency injection; you can manage state but need external solutions for DI.
```
Routing:
```
GetX has built-in routing capabilities for easy navigation.
Provider, Riverpod, and Bloc do not handle routing and rely on Flutter's default Navigator or external routing libraries.
```
